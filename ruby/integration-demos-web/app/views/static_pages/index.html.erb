    <div class="span6"><p>This demonstrates how to embed the signing of a document within
        your own web application.  A URL for viewing and signing the document is created through calls to the DocuSign API.  This URL is sent as a redirect to the client browser.  Once the signing process is complete, the client browser is redirected back to a URL of your choosing.</p></div>
